# SUMMaRIZER

SUMMaRIZER is an NLP text summarizer, one of the NLP (Natural Language Processing) technologies, that compresses long documents into shortened versions while 
retaining important information. We use these summaries in a variety of situations. While reading a book, the blurb at the back gives us a broad notion of what the 
book is about; news apps frequently feature a small caption that talks about the article; and movie reviews are another instance where summaries are beneficial. The 
amount of data available expands exponentially every day. It is critical to provide the news suitably and beneficially in this regard. Long articles are tiring to 
comprehend and take a long time to read. Text summarization is a method of compacting a vast amount of information into a summary. The abstract is processed in a few 
sentences with meaning and data preserved. A person who reads the entire text in one sitting may miss important details. SUMMaRIZER, on the other hand, will scan the 
article and provide all of the necessary information in a single scan. A summary summarizes a lengthy material by presenting the most critical elements. It lets the 
reader to fully comprehend the information merely by reading the synopsis, saving time and giving the reader the option of reading the entire text. Only the most 
important details are recognized because summaries should be shorter than the original content. The prime objective is that the readers have to understand what the 
article is about without reading it entirely. Extractive summarization is used, which takes the lines or phrases from the source and summarizes them. These top-
scoring sentences are combined to create a summary without altering the source document.
